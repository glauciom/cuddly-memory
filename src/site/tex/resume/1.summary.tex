\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I’m a passionate computer programmer with Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and 20 years
of practical experience on several IT platforms and programming languages, creating and maintaining
products / on-demand projects throughout all software life cycle / ecosystems.
I always do my best about \textbf{everything} I’m committed to accomplish, no matter I’m an expert
or not on what it has to be done.

Between 2006-2013 I owned a small consultancy company
($[gm]^2$ Intelligent Systems), focused mostly on R\&D, machine learning and time series forecasting.

Since I have moved from Brazil to Germany, my ultimate goal is to put myself again in a top leadership position.
